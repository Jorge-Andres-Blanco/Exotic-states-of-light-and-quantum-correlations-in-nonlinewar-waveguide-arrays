Here we are interested in the evolution of the quantum state of light as it propagates through a coupled array of nonlinear waveguides, based on the study of Barral et al. "Quantum state engineering in arrays of nonlinear waveguides".
In these nonlinear waveguides, spontaneous down conversion (SPDC) can take place as well as the evanescent coulpling to the nearest-neighbor waveguide.
An imput signal with frequency $\omega_h$ is injected into the nonlinear waveguide array (WGA), and because of SPDC, there is an output signal with a frequency $\omega_s$ which is the one we describe using fock states. 

## Some simplifications and asumptions

We focus on the low intensity regime, and therefore, asume that only few SPDC events take place in the system.
This way we can simulate multiple waveguides with low dimensionality fock states (the amount of down-converted photons we are able to simulate depend on the of the dimension of the fock states used to describe the system).
Also, for the sake of simplicity we consider that the down-converted photons have an equal frequency, this is, $\omega_h = 2\omega_s$.
Finally, as mentioned above, we only consider the nearest-neighbor coupling. In reality, coupling can occur between all waveguides, however, the coupling has higher probability with the nearest ones.
